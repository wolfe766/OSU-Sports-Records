# Web Scraper
This is a ruby program that scrapes sports data off of http://ohiostatebuckeyes.com and outputs a win/loss/tie record, season stats, and information about each match for most supported sports.

It is written in Ruby and uses the Nokogiri and Mechanize Ruby Gems to perform the scraping. Data output is done using ERB (embedded ruby code) inside of HTML pages.
